## A) Product Summary

**Fresh** is a comprehensive SaaS platform for salon management and booking. It connects salon owners, staff, and clients through three distinct surfaces:

1. **Dashboard (Backoffice):** `/dashboard/salon/[id]/*`
   - For Owners, Managers, and Staff.
   - Manages calendar, bookings, clients, staff, inventory, payments, and marketing.

2. **Booking Widget:** `/book/[salonId]`
   - For Clients.
   - Embeddable 4-step wizard for online appointment booking.

3. **Marketplace:** `/` (Home), `/salons` (Search), `/salon/[id]` (Profile)
   - For Clients.
   - Public directory to discover salons, view profiles, and access booking widgets.

## C) Key Flows

### 1. Booking Flow (Public)

1. **Selection:** Categories → Services (with per-service staff assignment) → Date/Time.
2. **Auth:** Client logs in or registers (Name, Email, Phone).
3. **Confirmation:** Booking created (`pending` status). Notifications sent (Email/SMS).
4. **Database:** Creates entry in `bookings`, `booking_services` (with individual staff assignments), and `salon_clients`.

**Multi-Service Feature (Fresha-style):**

- Clients can select multiple services in a single booking
- Each service can be assigned to a different staff member
- Staff selector appears per service showing available staff with color indicators
- Availability API checks that ALL selected staff are free at the chosen time
- Total duration calculated across all services
- Individual staff assignments saved in `booking_services.staff_id`

### 2. Walk-in / Manual Booking (Dashboard)

1. Receptionist opens Calendar or Clients panel.
2. **Find or Create Client:** Calls `POST /api/clients`. The request goes through `findOrCreateClient()` in `src/lib/client.js` — the single authoritative dedup path:
   - Phone match → `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` returns existing user.
   - Email match → same.
   - Neither → `INSERT` with `ER_DUP_ENTRY` race recovery.
   - `salon_clients` row upserted in the same transaction (`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`).
3. **Create Booking:** Selects Client + Service(s) + Staff + Time. Status defaults to `confirmed`.
4. **Notes:** Per-salon notes live in `salon_clients.notes`, not in `users`.

**Dedup guarantees:**

- Same phone + concurrent POST → second request blocks on `FOR UPDATE` lock, reuses existing row.
- Hard duplicate impossible: no route other than `lib/client.js` may INSERT into `users`.
- Soft-deleted client re-books → `is_active = 1` set automatically in the same upsert.

### 3. Checkout & Payment

1. Status Flow: `pending` → `confirmed` (arrived) → `completed` (checkout).
2. **Checkout Screen:** Staff confirms services, adds retail products/tips/discounts.
3. **Payment:** Records payment method (Cash/Card/Terminal). Status `paid`.
4. **Refunds:** Supports partial/full refunds via Sales history.

### 4. Marketplace Discovery

1. **Search:** By service name, location, price, rating.
2. **Results:** Listings powered by SQL search (not mock data).
3. **Profile:** Shows services, team, reviews (read-only), about/amenities.

### 5. Salon Deletion (Soft Delete)

1. Owner navigates to Settings → General → Danger Zone.
2. System checks for blockers (pending bookings, active gift cards, packages).
3. If blockers exist, owner can cancel them manually or "Force Delete".
4. Confirmation dialog requires typing salon name to proceed.
5. Soft delete: `deleted_at` timestamp set, salon hidden from all queries.
6. Staff deactivated, pending bookings cancelled automatically.

## D) Architecture Overview

### Frontend (Next.js 16.1 App Router)

- **Tech Stack:** React 19, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui (Radix), TanStack Query v5.
- **Security:**
  - Input validation via Zod schemas (`src/lib/validate.js`)
  - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
  - XSS protection (React auto-escaping)
  - Request size limits (2MB max)
  - Comprehensive length limits on all text inputs
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src/app/(auth)`: Auth pages.
  - `src/app/(public)`: Marketplace & Widget pages.
  - `src/app/dashboard`: Protected backoffice routes.
  - `src/components`: Grouped by domain (`bookings`, `calendar`, `marketing`, etc.).
  - `src/lib`: Core utilities (`api-client.js`, `db.js`, `format.js`, `validate.js`, `rate-limit.js`, `notifications.js`, `checkout.js`).
- **State Management:**
  - **Server State:** TanStack Query (auto-caching, invalidation).
  - **Form State:** React Hook Form + Zod validation.
  - **Client State:** URL parameters (search filters) or local state. (NO global store like Redux/Zustand).

### Authentication

- **Method:** JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies (`token`).
- **Security:**
  - Strong JWT secret validation (min 32 chars, no fallback)
  - Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12)
  - Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 min on login/register
  - SameSite=Strict cookies (CSRF protection)
  - IDOR protection with strict ID validation
- **Password Requirements:**
  - Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128
  - Must contain: lowercase, uppercase, number, special character
- **Email Validation:** Strict regex, normalized to lowercase, max 255 chars
- **Logic:** `src/lib/auth.js` handling session verification and role checks.
- **Rate Limiter:** `src/lib/rate-limit.js` (in-memory, auto-cleanup)
- **Helpers:** `useAuth` hook, `api-client.js` (auto-injects token).

## E) API Contract

All routes prefixed with `/api`. Authenticated via Cookie/Bearer token.

## F) Database Model

**Primary DB:** MySQL  
**Migrations:** `database/migrations/` directory

### Core Entities

- **Salons:** The root entity. Supports soft delete via `deleted_at` column.
- **Users:** Global identity (Clients, Staff, Owners). Personal info (Email, Phone).
- **Salon_Clients:** Join table (User <-> Salon). Stores salon-specific notes & loyalty stats.
- **Bookings:** The core transactional record. Contains `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `total_price`, `status`. Supports `deleted_at` for soft delete.
- **Booking_Services:** Junction table linking bookings to services with individual `staff_id` per service.
- **Staff:** Staff members with `color` field for calendar visualization.
- **Service_Staff:** Many-to-many relationship between services and staff.
- **Staff_Shifts:** Working hours definition.

### Soft Delete Fields

| Table         | Soft Delete Column         | Added       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| salons        | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | Feb 19 2026 |
| bookings      | `deleted_at`               | Jan 2026    |
| services      | `deleted_at`               | Jan 2026    |
| products      | `deleted_at`               | Jan 2026    |
| salon_clients | `is_active` (0 = removed)  | Feb 22 2026 |

> `salon_clients` uses `is_active` instead of `deleted_at` because the row must be re-activated (not re-inserted) when a removed client returns. `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is_active = 1` in a single upsert covers both the new-client and returning-client paths.

### Migrations History

| 2026-02-22 | `20260222_add_salon_clients_soft_delete.sql` | `is_active` + `updated_at` + index  |

### Data Management

- **Setup Script:** `database/setup_fresh_db.sql` (Schema + Truncate).
- **Seed Data:** `database/seed_data.sql` (Idempotent inserts).
  - Creates 6 Owners (`owner@fresh.com` ... `owner6@fresh.com`).
  - Password for all seeds: `password123`.

---

## G) Deployment & Environment

### Standard Setup

1. **Install:** `npm install`
2. **Env:** Copy `.env.example` -> `.env.local`.
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=...
   JWT_SECRET=...  # REQUIRED: Min 32 chars, no weak fallback
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
   ```
   **Generate secure JWT_SECRET:**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```
3. **Run:** `npm run dev`
4. **Tests:** `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright).

### Deployment

- **Target:** Vercel (Recommended) or Docker/VPS.
- **Build:** `npm run build`.
- **Secrets:** Ensure `JWT_SECRET` (min 32 chars) and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` are set in production.
- **Security Headers:** HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options configured in `next.config.mjs`.
- **Rate Limiting:** In-memory rate limiter active (consider Redis for production scale).

## I) Recent Updates & Features

### Client Management System (February 22, 2026)

**Overview:** Full production-safe client management built across 9 steps. Covers creation, search, edit, history, deletion, deduplication, and performance.

#### Core Library — `src/lib/client.js`

The single authoritative path for finding or creating a client. No route file may INSERT into `users` directly.

**`findOrCreateClient(data)`** — exported function:

```
phone provided → SELECT FOR UPDATE → found: patch name via COALESCE, reuse
no match, email → SELECT FOR UPDATE → found: patch name+phone, reuse
no match        → INSERT INTO users (role='client', password_hash='')
                  ER_DUP_ENTRY race: re-SELECT winning row, no retry
salonId given   → INSERT INTO salon_clients ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is_active=1
```

Returns `{ userId, isNew, isNewToSalon }`.

Also exports: `normalizePhone(raw)` (strips spaces/dashes/dots), `ClientError` (typed HTTP error).

#### API Endpoints

**`POST /api/clients`**

- Validates: `salonId`, `firstName`, at least one of `phone` / `email`.
- Delegates entirely to `findOrCreateClient()`. Route has zero INSERT logic.
- Accepts camelCase and snake_case field names.
- Response includes `isNew` and `isNewToSalon` flags.

**`GET /api/clients?salonId=&search=&page=&limit=`**

- Smart driving-table strategy based on input type:
  - **Phone** (`/^[\d\s+\-.]+$/`) → drives `FROM users`, hits `idx_users_phone`
  - **Email** (contains `@`) → drives `FROM users`, hits `uq_users_email`
  - **Name / empty** → drives `FROM salon_clients`, hits `idx_salon_clients_active`
- All LIKE patterns are `term%` (prefix) — never `%term%`.
- `COUNT(*) OVER()` returns total in same query (no second round-trip).
- Limit capped at 50. `is_active = 1` filter on all paths.

**`GET /api/clients/[id]?salonId=`**

- Returns user profile + `salonStats` (first visit, last visit, total visits).

**`PUT /api/clients/[id]`**

- Explicit-presence semantics: only fields sent are updated (missing fields untouched).
- Phone/email conflict checks inside `FOR UPDATE` transaction → 409 `PHONE_TAKEN` / `EMAIL_TAKEN`.
- Notes live in `salon_clients` (per-salon), not in `users`.

**`DELETE /api/clients/[id]?salonId=`**

- **Never hard-deletes.** Sets `salon_clients.is_active = 0`.
- `users` row and all `bookings` rows untouched — history preserved.
- Re-booking the same client auto-sets `is_active = 1` via upsert.

**`GET /api/clients/[id]/bookings?salonId=`**

- Paginated booking history: two-query strategy (bookings with window count + services batch IN()).

#### Access Control

All client endpoints accept **any active staff member** (manager or receptionist). The old `AND role='manager'` guard has been removed from every client route.

#### Duplicate Prevention — Guarantee Map

| Scenario                              | Mechanism                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## J) Changelog

### February 23, 2026

  - Added `total` count via subquery for proper pagination
  - Implemented `openNow` filter using `business_hours` table (day_of_week + time range)
  - Explicit field mapping in response (no spread of raw DB row)
  - Response shape: `{ data[], total, limit, offset, hasMore }`
  - All 4 safety gates hardcoded: `status='active'`, `is_active=1`, `deleted_at IS NULL`, `is_marketplace_enabled=1`
  - N+1 eliminated: services preview inlined via `GROUP_CONCAT`

### February 23, 2026

**Notifications & Email Integration**

- ✅ Built `src/lib/notifications.js` — `sendNotification()` with Resend email integration + console fallback
- ✅ Integrated booking confirmation emails into booking creation flow
- ✅ Integrated cancellation emails into `PUT /api/bookings/[id]` (status=cancelled)
- ✅ Created `GET /api/cron/reminders` — triggers upcoming appointment reminders (24h window)

**Discounts & Gift Cards**

- ✅ `GET /api/salons/[id]/discounts/[code]` — validate discount code (active dates, usage limits, min purchase)
- ✅ `GET /api/gift-cards/[code]` — validate gift card balance
- ✅ Updated `createSafeBooking()` in `src/lib/booking.js` to apply discounts and gift cards during booking
- ✅ Writes to `booking_discounts`, `booking_gift_cards` tables; increments usage / decrements balance

**Marketing Campaigns (MVP)**

- ✅ `POST /api/salons/[id]/campaigns` — create campaign draft with Zod validation
- ✅ `GET /api/salons/[id]/campaigns` — list campaigns with status filter
- ✅ `POST /api/salons/[id]/campaigns/[id]/send` — blast to audience (all/new/returning/inactive via `salon_clients`)
- ✅ Uses `sendNotification()` for dispatch, tracks `recipient_count` and `sent_count`

**Reviews (MVP)**

- ✅ Updated `POST /api/salons/[id]/reviews` — now links review to `booking_id`, validates completed booking ownership
- ✅ `PATCH /api/salons/[id]/reviews/[id]/reply` — salon owner/manager reply endpoint
- ✅ Public reviews already filtered by `status='approved'` in marketplace API

**Admin Platform Controls (MVP)**

- ✅ `PATCH /api/admin/salons/[salonId]/status` — activate/deactivate salons (admin-only)
- ✅ Existing `GET /api/admin/salons` and `GET /api/admin/users` cover list + metrics

**Level 2 — Money Flow (Checkout & Payment Recording)**

- ✅ Built `src/lib/checkout.js` — core money logic library:
  - `calculateBookingTotal()` — server-computed from DB (services + products − discounts − gift cards)
  - `addProductToBooking()` — validates product, inserts at DB price, decrements stock
  - `processCheckout()` — transactional checkout with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locking
- ✅ `GET /api/bookings/[id]/total` — read-only total breakdown
- ✅ `POST /api/bookings/[id]/products` — add products at checkout
- ✅ `POST /api/bookings/[id]/checkout` — full transactional checkout (lock → validate → compute → pay → complete)
- ✅ Strict booking status lifecycle enforced: `pending → confirmed → completed` (no backward transitions)
- ✅ One payment per booking enforced (code + `UNIQUE(booking_id)` DB constraint)
- ✅ All money logic uses `db.transaction()` with `ROLLBACK` on any failure

**Validation Schemas Added**

- ✅ `createCampaignSchema`, `replyReviewSchema`, `updateSalonStatusSchema`
- ✅ `addBookingProductSchema`, `checkoutSchema`

### February 24, 2026

**Notification System (Frontend)**

- ✅ Created `src/hooks/use-notifications.js` hook — fetches, marks read, deletes notifications with 30s polling
- ✅ Created `src/components/layout/notification-popover.jsx` — popover with unread badge, scrollable list, mark-all-read, per-notification mark-read/delete actions, empty state
- ✅ Replaced static bell button in `header.jsx` with `NotificationPopover` component
- ✅ Updated `GET /api/notifications` to include `isRead` field and `unreadCount` in response

**Bug Fixes**

- ✅ Fixed infinite re-render loop on Account Settings page (`switch.jsx` crash)
  - Root cause: `useCurrentUser()` returned a new object literal every render, causing `useEffect([user])` to fire infinitely
  - Fix: Added `useRef` initialization guard so effect only runs once
- ✅ Fixed `products?.filter is not a function` crash on Products page
  - Root cause: `useProducts` hook `select` transform didn't handle nested API response `{success:true, data:{data:[...]}}`
  - Fix: Updated `select` to correctly extract the array from nested response
- ✅ Fixed `/profile` 404 error — link now points to `/dashboard/settings` instead
- ✅ Removed global CSS transition rule from `globals.css` that conflicted with component transitions

**UI/UX Improvements**

- ✅ Removed all emojis from marketplace homepage (✨ sparkle badge, 💇 fallback icon → replaced with text/Scissors icon)
- ✅ Created footer pages: `/contact`, `/help`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
- ✅ Fixed login page button spacing (`mt-6` on CardFooter)
- ✅ Fixed cursor pointer on all interactive elements via `globals.css`

### February 22, 2026

- ✅ Built full client management system (`src/lib/client.js` + 4 route files)
- ✅ `findOrCreateClient()` — single dedup path, phone FOR UPDATE → email FOR UPDATE → INSERT + race recovery
- ✅ `POST /api/clients` — delegates entirely to lib, zero inline INSERT logic
- ✅ `GET /api/clients` — smart driving-table search (phone/email drive FROM users, name/empty drive FROM salon_clients)
- ✅ `PUT /api/clients/[id]` — explicit-presence fields, `PHONE_TAKEN`/`EMAIL_TAKEN` 409 conflict errors
- ✅ `DELETE /api/clients/[id]` — soft-delete (`is_active=0`), never hard-deletes
- ✅ `GET /api/clients/[id]/bookings` — paginated history, `COUNT(*) OVER()` single round-trip
- ✅ `salon_clients` soft-delete: added `is_active`, `updated_at`, `idx_salon_clients_active`
- ✅ Migrations: `20260222_add_client_search_indexes.sql`, `20260222_add_salon_clients_soft_delete.sql`
- ✅ Removed `AND role='manager'` guard from all client routes — receptionists now have full access

## K) Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Mobile App:** Planned but not implemented. Dashboard is web-responsive.
2. **Notifications:** In-app notification popover is fully implemented (fetch, mark-read, delete, 30s polling). Email integration via Resend requires `RESEND_API_KEY` env var; falls back to console logging without it. Push notifications not yet implemented.
3. **Multi-Currency:** Supported in `format.js` but UI assumes single salon currency.
4. **Rate Limiter:** In-memory (single-server). Consider Redis for production.
5. **Payments:** Manual cash/card recording is production-ready. Stripe online payments, partial payments, split payments, and refund flows are not yet implemented.
6. **Soft Delete Recovery:** No UI for restoring deleted salons (admin-only via DB).
7. **Phone normalization:** `normalizePhone()` strips spaces/dashes/dots but does not convert local Algerian format (`0555…`) to E.164 (`+2135…`). Stored format depends on what the receptionist typed first.
8. **Account Settings:** Uses a mock `useCurrentUser()` hook with hardcoded data. In production, integrate with auth context to pull real user data.

---

## L) Roadmap

1. **Salon Recovery UI:** Admin interface to restore deleted salons
2. **Enhanced Rate Limiting:** Redis-based for multi-server deployments
3. **2FA Implementation:** Two-factor authentication for admin/owner accounts
4. **CI/CD:** Enforce `test:e2e` on Pull Requests
5. **Marketplace SEO:** Server-side metadata for salon profiles
6. **Security Monitoring:** Logging for rate limit hits and failed auth attempts
7. **Permanent Purge:** Background job to permanently delete after 90-day retention
8. **Phone Normalization:** E.164 conversion (`+213…`) with country-code awareness for dedup across formats
9. **Client Import:** Bulk CSV import via `findOrCreateClient()` (dedup-safe by design)
10. **Salon Recovery UI:** Restore soft-deleted `salon_clients` rows (currently admin-only via DB update)
